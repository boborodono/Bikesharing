# NYC Citibike Analysis

## Overview
The reason for this project is to help Kate convince potential angel investors (using analysis created in Tableau) to consider starting a bicycle ride-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results
![Checkout Time for Users](/Images/Checkout_Times.png)
#### A vast majority of Users rent bikes in NYC for less than an hour. </br></br>

![Checkout Times Analysis](/Images/Trip_Duration(Gender).png)
#### Males overwhelmingly use the service more than Females or Unknowns...</br></br>

#### The most usage occurs around 8 AM and 5-6 PM during the week suggesting Users often utilize the service to get to and from work.</br></br>

#### Males dominate the userbase at almost any time or day.</br></br>

![Trips by Gender(Weekday per Hour)](/Images/User_Trips(Gender)_by_Weekday.png)
#### Male and Female subscribers alike are more likely to use the service during the week. However, there is an uptick of usage by customers on the weekends. We deduce this is because of an increase in tourist activity and casual users on the weekends.</br></br>


## Summary

### The analysis shows:
### - Most bike rentals occur right before and after a typical 9-5 workday.
### - Most users are Males.
### - Most rentals are dedicated to short trips of less than 30 minutes in duration.
### - The bikes with the most usage are usually concentrated in areas with tourist attractions, business operations, and mixed use areas where residential and commerce are in close proximity. (See figures below)

#### Most rides start in areas of high traffic and are concentrated in locations where business is conducted and tourists frequent.</br></br>

![Top NYC Ending Locations](/Images/NYC_End.png)
#### The areas where Users start their trip are also the areas where most trips end... This makes sense as most trips do not exceed more than 30 minutes and are mostly used for travelling relatively short distances.
